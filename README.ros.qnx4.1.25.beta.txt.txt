Before You Begin
================

IMPORTANT: This code is BETA code and under constant development. 

* Do not try and install this code over and existing RST-ROS disribution

     There are a number of fiddly little differences in environment
     variable definitions, filename conventions and the like. The two
     versions do not play well together yet. 
     Also large chunks of code have been re-written and the version
     numbers will cause problems with the old code.
 
     Install this version of RST-ROS in a nice clean new directory

* Environment variables have been changed

     The format of some of the radar tables has changed, and at
     an early stage is made sense to define new environment variables
     to reference these new files, so:

     SD_RADAR	     replaces SD_RADARNAME
     SD_HDWPATH      replaces SD_HARDWARE

     Also note that SD_HDWPATH points to the directory containing the
     hardware files, NOT the filename prefix as before.  (The hardware
     file is now referenced in "radar.dat").

* Data directories are different

     The "/data/dat" directory has become "/data/raw".

* Some program names have been changed

     "dio_drive" becomes "diopio48c"
     "a_d_drive" becomes "dt2828"

     This is to reflect changes in hardware

* Control program names are different

     normal_scan becomes normalscan
     fast_scan becomes fastscan

* Filenames and station identifiers

     Filenames are given with a full time specification.
     Three letter codes are used for the radar ID.

* Script names use a "." rather than "_"

     start_radar becomes start.radar
     stop_radar becomes stop.radar
     start_driver becomes start.driver





Creating Accounts
-----------------

The Radar Operating System is run from its own private user account which you
must create before installing the software.  By conventino the software is
run from an accoutn called "radar".  To create this account, login as
super-user (root) and use the passwd utility:

     passwd radar

You will be prompted for a user ID (UID) and a group ID (GID).  You can either
use the suggested values by typing enter or you can choose you own.
You probably will not want to mix the radar account with your regular
user accounts so a good choice is to create an account with UID of 1000 in
its own group with GID of 1000.

You will then need to add the following line to the /etc/group file:

     radar:*:1000


Install the Support Scripts
---------------------------

before you can instal the Radar Operating System you must install the support
scripts which are stored in the archive "support.x.xx.tar.F", the ("x.xx"
signifies the version number of the archive).
copy this archive into the root directory and type:

     install -u support.x.xx.tar.F

This will install the two scripts "rpkg" and "make_sudo" into the
directory "/usr/local/bin".


Install the ROS software
========================

You are now ready to install the ROS software.  Login using the user
name "radar".  There are three ROS software packages; the main Operating System
("ros.qnx4.x.yy.sh"), the site package for your radar ("site.zzz.x.yy.sh"),
and the control program package ("cp.x.yy.sh").  Copy these three
files into the home directory of the radar account ("/home/radar").  Make
sure that they are executable by typing:

chmod a+x ros.qnx.x.yy.sh
chmod a+x site.zzz.x.yy.sh
chmod a+y cp.zzz.x.yy.sh

Now install the main Operating System by typing:

     ./ros.qnx4.x.yy.sh

The installation directory will be displayed on the console and you will be
asked whether you wish to proceed.  Once the directory structure is created
and the software is installed you will be asked if you wish to compile
the core software and create the symbolic links to the library headers.

Once you have installed the software you must update your ".profile" file to
include the ROS environment variables.  You must add the following lines
to "/home/radar/.profile":

     export HOMEPATH=${HOME}
     . profile.ros.ksh
     . profile.site.ksh


Configuring the .profile.ros.ksh file
-------------------------------------

Here's a little thing you'll need to do:  find the .profile.ros.ksh file
that was installed with the installation of the ROS.  Edit this file
such that the "export HOMEPATH=/home/radar" line is uncommented and points
to the directory where you executed the ./ros.qnx4.x.yy.sh script.

Next update the environment by either logging out and logging back into the radar
account or by typing:

    . .profile

(Alternatively you can incorporate the contents of "profile.ros.ksh" and
"profile.site.ksh" into ".profile").

Once this is complete you can install the site package by typing:

    ./site.zzz.x.yy.sh

The installation directory will be displayed on the console and you will be
asked whether you wish to proceed.  Once the directory structure is created
and the software is installed you will be asked if you wish to create
the symbolic links to the library headers.

Once you have installed the site library, you can install the control programs
by typing:

    ./cp.x.yy.sh


Setting up the Operating System
===============================

Creating Data Directories
-------------------------

The data and log files created by the Operating System are stored in 
sub-directories of the "/data" directory. You can create the required directory
tree by typing:

    make.data

Compiling the Code
------------------

Type the command:

    make.all

This will compile the operating system, the site libaries and the control 
programs that you have installed.

Testing the software (Debug Mode)
---------------------------------

You should now be able to test that Operating System is working. Type the 
command:

    start.debug

This should run the software in debug mode using a short test file. You can
check that everything is working by typing:

    tdisplay

You can exit the display by pressing 'Q' or  "<ctrl-C>". Shutdown the 
Operating System by typing:

    stop.debug


Configuring the Timing Computer
-------------------------------

Login as super-user (root) and copy the file "/home/radar/bin/diopio48c" to
the root directory of the timing computer. Then add the line:

./diopio48c -p 0x700

to the "/etc/config/sysinit.2" file to run this program at boot time.  Here the
"0x700" relates to the dip switches on the pio48c card's position 1-4.  In binary
these switches should be set to 7 for the best operation of the radar.

Be sure to remove the diopio48c file frome the "/home/radar/bin" directory on the 
main QNX computer.

Selecting the Appropriate RX Driver
----------------------------------

Before starting the radar, you must configure the appropriate digital
receiver card driver for your particular radar.  Edit the "start.driver"
file in the "/home/radar/script" directory such that your particular 
driver is uncommented.  When done, save this file.

Also, be sure that the ~/usr/code/src.lib/rad*/site/site.*/src/hdw.c
file has the appropriate name of the RX driver by the DRNAME variable.
You can find the name of the RX driver by typing 'sin names' on the
main QNX computer.


Configuring the Main Computer
-----------------------------

Add the following lines to the end of the "/etc/config/sysinit.1" file:

     ./home/radar/script/start.driver
     su radar /home/radar/script/start.radar

Installing a Schedule
---------------------

Before you can run the radar you must install a schedule file, an example is
provided in the file "/home/radar/radar.scd". Login as "radar", edit this 
file and copy it to the directory "/data/scd".

Run the Radar
-------------

Now reboot the system. If everything works according to plan, the radar you 
should now be running the new software.

Operations
----------

All of the operations for the radar are controlled from the "radar" account. 
To stop the radar type:

    stop.radar

To restart the radar type:
   
   start.radar
